#1 steps of insertion sort
[22,27,16,2,18,6] 
[2,27,16,22,18,6] 
[2,6,16,22,18,27]
[2,6,16,18,22,27]

#2 Big-O Notation
O(n^2)

#3 Time Complexity
Average case: O(n^2) for n=6 ==> 6^2=36  
Worst case: O(n^2) for n=6 ==> 6^2=36  
Best case: O(n) for n=6 ==> 6

#4 After sorting 18 will be in which case?
The number we are looking for is in the middle of the array. It will be held in average case.
